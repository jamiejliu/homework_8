              <div class="col-sm-9">
                The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically altered our everyday lives.  Events like going to work, attending college, or grabbing dinner with friends have been reshaped as we are encouraged to wear masks and social distance to keep our loved ones safe. Grocery shopping is an essential part of life that has also been affected by the pandemic. <br>

                <br>For this project, my team and I worked with Amazon, a company that is more receptive to change given their customer-centric, tech-savvy culture. We explored ways to improve Whole Foods’ existing delivery service, which currently offers contactless delivery for Amazon Prime members. <br>

                <br> <span class="amazonBold">How can we redesign the grocery shopping experience that keeps our users safe and provides them with the food they want? Can we create a service that continues to add value to both the user and the company after the pandemic ends?</span>

              <div class="col-sm-9">
                Create a grocery delivery service that gives users the trust they feel when shopping in-person with the convenience of delivery. Design a responsive website that adds value to the users and the company, during and after the pandemic.

                <h3 class="text-sm-end">Problem Space</h3>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm-9">
                Because of our short timeline, we conducted <span class="amazonBold">pop-up research with directed storytelling</span> to understand the existing problem space.<br>

                <br>My team conducted 12 pop-up interviews, selecting a range of interviewees who have grocery shopped during the pandemic, both in-person and using a delivery service. We wanted to understand the benefits and drawbacks of both types of shopping as well as <span class="amazonBold">why people choose one over the other.</span><br>

                <br>We recorded each experience in a customer journey map like the one below:<br>
                <img src="images/Amazon-CJM.png" id="amazonCJM" alt="Amazon Customer Journey Map"> <br>


                <br> From our interviews, we had the following takeaways regarding the problem space:
                <ul>
                  <li>People have varying levels of enjoyment with grocery shopping </li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Some dread it and see it as a chore </li>
                    <li>Others view it as a social experience or look forward to leaving the house </li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>When grocery shopping online, it’s difficult to communicate the details of produce (quantity, ripeness, etc.)</li>
                  <li>Inaccurate orders or replacement choices are frustrations that are associated with delivery </li>
                </ul>

                <br>We focused on addressing the following <span class="amazonBold">pain points:</span>
                <ul>
                  <li>User's distrust of shopper ability </li>
                  <li>User's dissatisfaction with quality of produce selected </li>
                </ul>

              <div class="col-sm-9">
                Following multiple rounds of iteration, from paper prototypes with think-aloud testing to high-fidelity prototypes, my team arrived at our final deliverable: <br>

                <br> Since we were adding a new feature, we heavily drew UI inspiration from existing Amazon UI for a cohesive appearance.<br>

                <h3 class="text-sm-end">Takeaways</h3>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm-9">
                From this project, I realized how <span class="amazonBold">I can add value to a team with my business background.</span> Since we proposed modifying an existing service, we needed to consider how the change would add value to both the user and the business, and I found myself leading these conversations with my teammates. <br>

                <br>Our largest hurdle was ensuring the persona that would benefit from this redesign and benefit the company. <span class="amazonBold">We understood that not everyone will want to switch to only using delivery, so we had to specifically cater our persona to people who would prefer delivery currently because of the pandemic and/or people who value efficiency and dislike in-person shopping.</span><br>

                <br>My understanding of the retail (grocery) industry helped me identify that <span class="amazonBold">the ultimate goal of this service on the business side would be to help Whole Foods differentiate itself from its competitors and create customer loyalty.</span> Because I could view the persona through the business lens, I drove the conversation in modifying our persona forward to satisfy these needs.<br>

                <br>Our reimagined Whole Foods delivery service adds value to users with its convenience and reliability. It adds value to Whole Foods by drawing customers from competitors and creating loyalty in the competitive industry to increase their marketshare and profits. <br>
