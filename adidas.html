                Today, data plays an important role in the decision-making process. For retailers, the industry is in a mature state, meaning there is intense competition for a finite amount of customers. Here, data becomes critical as retailers can use data to better understand their consumers, helping them gain market share and increase profits.<br>

                <br>The executives at Adidas would like to push toward a data-driven future, but not all of their employees share the same sentiment. Those unfamiliar with working with data view it as overwhelming, boring, or irrelevant to their work.<br>

                <br><span class="adidasBold">How can we present data for Adidas team members in a way that is simple and easily digestible, yet also insightful and inspirational to encourage them to make data-driven decisions?</span><br>

                For this project, we were given the following constraints:
                <ul>
                  <li>Must design 1 dashboard (i.e. no personalization)</li>
                  <li> Dashboard will be a widescreen 16x9 full HD screen located in the Portland office </li>
                  <li> 3 personas are given (see below) </li>

                For this project, we were given 3 personas, summarized below:
                <img src="images/Adidas-Personas.png" id="personas" alt="image with description of three personas: Sos, Kenny, and Ansela">

                <br>We used an affinity diagram to understand the needs of our users. I noticed how Kenny and Sos valued their connection with the physical, real-world, and I highlighted this to my group. I also considered how a designer like Sos may interact with data, and I expressed to my group how our dashboard should not only be informational, but also inspiring.<br>

                <br>We decided to focus on the following <span class="adidasBold">pain points:</span>
                <ul>
                  <li>Data does not communicate future customer needs</li>
                  <li>Data does not add value to the design process</li>
                  <li>Users must manually gather data from various sources and must know what they are searching for</li>
                  <li>Users feel a strong disconnect between the physical and digital world</li>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="row mt-5">
              <div class="col-sm-3">
                <h3 class="rightAlign"> <span class="text-sm-left"> Final Deliverables </span> </h3>

              <div class="col-sm-9">
                Our final dashboard would be located in the Portland office as pictured below, in a large common area that receives heavy foot-traffic. <br>
                <img src="images/Adidas-Office.png" id="office" alt="the dashboard in the Portland office space"><br><br>

                <br> We decided the best way to tell a story using data was to distribute the data across 3 different screens:<br>
                <img src="images/Adidas-Image.png" id="adidasDetails" alt="details explaining the design choices"> <br>
              </div>

              <div class="col-sm-3">
                <h3 class="rightAlign"> <span class="text-sm-left"> Takeaways </span> </h3>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm-9">
                This project was a great way to learn how <span class="adidasBold">to balance the needs of different personas.</span> Using an iterative design process, we were able to synthesize our data and feedback to pitch a final dashboard that addresses the needs of Ansela, Kenny, and Sos. While we designed each screen with a primary persona in mind, we also ensured that all the personas could benefit from every screen.<br>

                <br>This project helped me better my understanding of data visualization while also learning how to design with a virtual team. Because of COVID-19, my team and I learned how to work completely virtually. We developed a collaborative team culture without ever seeing each other in person, juggled different timezones, and discovered how to allocate work effectively, so we could take advantage of this virtual setting.
