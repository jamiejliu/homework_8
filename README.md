## c. Description:
i. What is the purpose of your website?
ii. What information do you convey with your website?
iii. How is it interesting and engaging?
iv. Who is the target audience?

i. For my final project, I coded a portfolio for myself. This portfolio displays a selection of projects and past work that showcase my skills. I currently have a portfolio that I built using a template, and I used this assignment as an opportunity to redesign my website, with more flexibility to make it more unique.

ii. With my website, I want to convey my skill set and experience, mainly using past experiences, but also through the design itself. On the home page of my website, I included the most important information about myself: my name, university, and a summary of my past work and past experiences. Each of the 3 past work previews displayed on the home page leads to an individual page with more details about the project.

iii. I have made my website interesting and engaging using visual design. I have a clean, modern style with different gradients and pops of color to make the portfolio more lively. In addition, I have implemented hover states to make it clear which parts of the page can be clicked on. Finally, I added animation so that the content fades in as users scroll, breaking down the information so it is not overwhelming.

iv. My target audience is recruiters. As a rising senior, I will be using my portfolio to recruit for full-time positions for UX Design after graduation.

## e. External libraries:
Bootstrap
* I used Bootstrap because it helped me implement responsive design. It helped me save time as I could easily style parts of my website within the html, instead of using css.
* I used Bootstrap to create my navigation bar and the content sections of each project. On mobile or small screens, the content sections collapse from two columns into one column.
* I was able to use the Bootstrap grid system to easily align the content headers with their respective content sections on each project page. This helped improve the visual appearance of my website. Bootstrap also helped me implement responsive design, ensuring my website is usable.

jQuery
* I used jQuery to add a simple fade in animation to the content on my portfolio. The text and images appear as the user scrolls down the page.
* I used it by applying the “fade” class to each individual paragraph in each of the content pages. I found this was better than applying it to an entire section of content because it helped the text appear at the right time.
* This adds more interaction to my website, making the overall experience more engaging. It also helps the website appear less overwhelming as paragraphs of text appear one at a time.


## f. Iteration from HW7:
My implemented website is very similar to my Figma prototype. I changed a few small details, like the text alignment in some areas and the order of experiences on the timeline. I also received feedback that the content paragraphs were a bit visually overwhelming, so I increased the spacing and used different font colors and weights to make my portfolio easier to read. Finally, I edited the navigation bar based off of a peer suggestion to include a dropdown menu to include all of the projects.


## g. Major challenges:
One of the challenges that I faced was in implementing the navigation bar. I struggled to keep the navigation bar fixed at the top of the screen, without covering up the information from the top of the body content. I also found it challenging at times to adapt to the bootstrap syntax, as right-align and left-align did not follow the normal HTML syntax when working in a responsive grid system. Finally, it was challenging to make my HTML responsive, and it took me a while to figure out how to left-align the content headers when the screen size is small.
